# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Problem Description

<!--TODO: Overall Problem Description-->

This	is	a	simple	counting	app	that	takes	a	head	count	of the	people	in	a	room.	It	
then	recognizes	them	uniquely	by	comparing	with previously stored	images	in	a	database,	or	adds	
them	to	the	database	if	theyâ€™re	not	already	present at the request of the user. The user can choose to add details about the people identified, and can access and edit these records at a later date.


## 1.2 Design Concept

<!--TODO: State the overall design concept-->

The project has two major portions: An autonomous car hardware and firmware suite that provides both remote-controlled and autonomous-assistive driving functions, and an Android app that performs photography, image recognition, mapping as well as adds intelligent guidance to the vehicle. 

The two portions are linked via a REST API, implemented over HTTP. This API provides an abstraction over the controls of the car, which allows easy manipulation and guidance of the vehicle through the Android app.
